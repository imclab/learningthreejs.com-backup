[Constructive solid Geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry)
is a way to build complex objects from simpler ones.
It uses [boolean operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets) such as
union, difference and intersection.

## Lets get started

You get csg.js from

, Three.js glue from
[here](http://chandler.prallfamily.com/labs/three/csg/ThreeCSG.js)
and add those 2 lines.

```javascript
	<script src="csg.js"></script>
	<script src="ThreeCSG.js"></script>
```
