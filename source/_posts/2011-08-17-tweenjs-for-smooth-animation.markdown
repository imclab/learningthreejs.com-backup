[tween.js](https://github.com/sole/tween.js) is a library which provides the basics to
animate your demo.
According to [sole](https://github.com/sole), the author, **tween.js**
is a javascript tweening engine which is
"Super simple, fast and easy to use tweening engine which incorporates optimised Robert Penner's equations."

Show, dont tell, here is a [demo](/data/tweenjs-for-smooth-animation/tweenjs-for-smooth-animation.html)
using tween.js

This post explains how to use it in your webgl demos, but tween.js scope is larger than that. It
can be used for any tweening.

* About demo, simply put a dat.gui with tuning with a live animation on the screen
* simply. go back and forth at first
* tune the easing, delay, duration, etc....
* something simple, maybe with a lot of particule, just to see it something nice on screen
