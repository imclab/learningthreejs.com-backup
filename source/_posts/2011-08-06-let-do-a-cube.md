title: Lets Do a Cube
---

This is the first lesson so i started with something real simple, a **cube**!
You can see this example live [here](/data/lets_do_a_cube/lets_do_a_cube.html).

I wasnt too sure how to present it. So i did a annotated source of the
javascript [here](/data/lets_do_a_cube/docs/lets_do_a_cube.html)
